-Basic formatting syntax
-Headings
-To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.
-
-# A first-level heading
-## A second-level heading
-### A third-level heading
-
-
-When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking {% octicon "list-unordered" aria-label="The unordered list icon" %} within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.
-
-
-
-Styling text
-You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.
-
-Style Syntax Keyboard shortcut Example Output
-Bold ** ** or __ __ Command+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux) **This is bold text** This is bold text
-Italic * * or _ _      Command+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux) _This text is italicized_ This text is italicized
-Strikethrough ~~ ~~ or ~ ~ None ~~This was mistaken text~~ This was mistaken text
-Bold and nested italic ** ** and _ _ None **This text is _extremely_ important** This text is extremely important
-All bold and italic *** *** None ***All this text is important*** All this text is important
-Subscript <sub> </sub> None This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text This is a subscript text
-Superscript <sup> </sup> None This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text This is a superscript text
-Underline <ins> </ins> None This is an <ins>underlined</ins> text This is an underlined text
-Quoting text
-You can quote text with a >.
-
-Text that is not a quote
-
-> Text that is a quote
-Quoted text is indented with a vertical line on the left and displayed using gray type.
-
-
-
-Note
-
-When viewing a conversation, you can automatically quote text in a comment by highlighting the text, then typing R. You can quote an entire comment by clicking {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}, then Quote reply. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see AUTOTITLE.
-
-Quoting code
-You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.
-
-Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
-
-
-To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
-
-Some basic Git commands are:
-```
-git status
-git add
-git commit
-```
-
-
-For more information, see AUTOTITLE.
-
-{% data reusables.user-settings.enabling-fixed-width-fonts %}
-
-Supported color models
-In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.
-
-The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.
-
-
-Here are the currently supported color models.
-
-Color Syntax Example Output
-HEX `#RRGGBB` `#0969DA`
-RGB `rgb(R,G,B)` `rgb(9, 105, 218)`
-HSL `hsl(H,S,L)` `hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`
-Note
-
-A supported color model cannot have any leading or trailing spaces within the backticks.
-The visualization of the color is only supported in issues, pull requests, and discussions.
-Links
-You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.
-
-You can also create a Markdown hyperlink by highlighting the text and using the keyboard shortcut Command+V. If you'd like to replace the text with the link, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+V.
-
-This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
-
-
-
-Note
-
-{% data variables.product.github %} automatically creates links when valid URLs are written in a comment. For more information, see AUTOTITLE.
-
-Section links
-{% data reusables.repositories.section-links %}
-
-If you need to determine the anchor for a heading in a file you are editing, you can use the following basic rules:
-
-Letters are converted to lower-case.
-Spaces are replaced by hyphens (-). Any other whitespace or punctuation characters are removed.
-Leading and trailing whitespace are removed.
-Markup formatting is removed, leaving only the contents (for example, _italics_ becomes italics).
-If the automatically generated anchor for a heading is identical to an earlier anchor in the same document, a unique identifier is generated by appending a hyphen and an auto-incrementing integer.
-For more detailed information on the requirements of URI fragments, see RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax, Section 3.5.
-
-The code block below demonstrates the basic rules used to generate anchors from headings in rendered content.
-
-# Example headings
-
-## Sample Section
-
-## This'll be a _Helpful_ Section About the Greek Letter Θ!
-A heading containing characters not allowed in fragments, UTF-8 characters, two consecutive spaces between the first and second words, and formatting.
-
-## This heading is not unique in the file
-
-TEXT 1
-
-## This heading is not unique in the file
-
-TEXT 2
-
-# Links to the example headings above
-
-Link to the sample section: [Link Text](#sample-section).
-
-Link to the helpful section: [Link Text](#thisll-be-a-helpful-section-about-the-greek-letter-Θ).
-
-Link to the first non-unique section: [Link Text](#this-heading-is-not-unique-in-the-file).
-
-Link to the second non-unique section: [Link Text](#this-heading-is-not-unique-in-the-file-1).
-Note
-
-If you edit a heading, or if you change the order of headings with "identical" anchors, you will also need to update any links to those headings as the anchors will change.
-
-Relative links
-{% data reusables.repositories.relative-links %}
-
-Custom anchors
-You can use standard HTML anchor tags (<a name="unique-anchor-name"></a>) to create navigation anchor points for any location in the document. To avoid ambiguous references, use a unique naming scheme for anchor tags, such as adding a prefix to the name attribute value.
-
-Note
-
-Custom anchors will not be included in the document outline/Table of Contents.
-
-You can link to a custom anchor using the value of the name attribute you gave the anchor. The syntax is exactly the same as when you link to an anchor that is automatically generated for a heading.
-
-For example:
-
-# Section Heading
-
-Some body text of this section.
-
-<a name="my-custom-anchor-point"></a>
-Some text I want to provide a direct link to, but which doesn't have its own heading.
-
-(… more content…)
-
-[A link to that custom anchor](#my-custom-anchor-point)
-Tip
-
-Custom anchors are not considered by the automatic naming and numbering behavior of automatic heading links.
-
-Line breaks
-If you're writing in issues, pull requests, or discussions in a repository, {% data variables.product.github %} will render a line break automatically:
-
-This example
-Will span two lines
-However, if you are writing in an .md file, the example above would render on one line without a line break. To create a line break in an .md file, you will need to include one of the following:
-
-Include two spaces at the end of the first line.
-
-This example  
-Will span two lines
-Include a backslash at the end of the first line.
-
-This example\
-Will span two lines
-Include an HTML single line break tag at the end of the first line.
-
-This example<br/>
-Will span two lines
-If you leave a blank line between two lines, both .md files and Markdown in issues, pull requests, and discussions will render the two lines separated by the blank line:
-
-This example
-
-Will have a blank line separating both lines
-Images
-You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().
-
-![Screenshot of a comment on a GitHub issue showing an image, added in the Markdown, of an Octocat smiling and raising a tentacle.](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)
-
-
-
-{% data variables.product.github %} supports embedding images into your issues, pull requests{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}, discussions{% endif %}, comments and .md files. You can display an image from your repository, add a link to an online image, or upload an image. For more information, see Uploading assets.
-
-Note
-
-When you want to display an image that is in your repository, use relative links instead of absolute links.
-
-Here are some examples for using relative links to display an image.
-
-Context Relative Link
-In a .md file on the same branch /assets/images/electrocat.png
-In a .md file on another branch /../main/assets/images/electrocat.png
-In issues, pull requests and comments of the repository ../blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=true
-In a .md file in another repository /../../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png
-In issues, pull requests and comments of another repository ../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=true
-Note
-
-The last two relative links in the table above will work for images in a private repository only if the viewer has at least read access to the private repository that contains these images.
-
-For more information, see Relative Links.
-
-The Picture element
-The <picture> HTML element is supported.
-
-Lists
-You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with -, *, or +.
-
-- George Washington
-* John Adams
-+ Thomas Jefferson
-
-
-To order your list, precede each line with a number.
-
-1. James Madison
-2. James Monroe
-3. John Quincy Adams
-
-
-Nested Lists
-You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.
-
-To create a nested list using the web editor on {% data variables.product.github %} or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.
-
-1. First list item
-   - First nested list item
-     - Second nested list item
-Note
-
-In the web-based editor, you can indent or dedent one or more lines of text by first highlighting the desired lines and then using Tab or Shift+Tab respectively.
-
-
-
-
-
-To create a nested list in the comment editor on {% data variables.product.github %}, which doesn't use a monospaced font, you can look at the list item immediately above the nested list and count the number of characters that appear before the content of the item. Then type that number of space characters in front of the nested list item.
-
-In this example, you could add a nested list item under the list item 100. First list item by indenting the nested list item a minimum of five spaces, since there are five characters (100. ) before First list item.
-
-100. First list item
-     - First nested list item
-
-
-You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven characters (␣␣␣␣␣-␣) before the nested list content First nested list item, you would need to indent the second nested list item by at least two more characters (nine spaces minimum).
-
-100. First list item
-     - First nested list item
-       - Second nested list item
-
-
-For more examples, see the GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec.
-
-Task lists
-{% data reusables.repositories.task-list-markdown %}
-
-If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \:
-
-- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue
-
-For more information, see AUTOTITLE.
-
-Mentioning people and teams
-You can mention a person or team on {% data variables.product.github %} by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. For more information about notifications, see AUTOTITLE.
-
-Note
-
-A person will only be notified about a mention if the person has read access to the repository and, if the repository is owned by an organization, the person is a member of the organization.
-
-@github/support What do you think about these updates?
-
-
-
-When you mention a parent team, members of its child teams also receive notifications, simplifying communication with multiple groups of people. For more information, see AUTOTITLE.
-
-Typing an @ symbol will bring up a list of people or teams on a project. The list filters as you type, so once you find the name of the person or team you are looking for, you can use the arrow keys to select it and press either tab or enter to complete the name. For teams, enter the @organization/team-name and all members of that team will get subscribed to the conversation.
-
-The autocomplete results are restricted to repository collaborators and any other participants on the thread.
-
-Referencing issues and pull requests
-You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing #. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result.
-
-For more information, see AUTOTITLE.
-
-Referencing external resources
-{% data reusables.repositories.autolink-references %}
-
-Uploading assets
-You can upload assets like images by dragging and dropping, selecting from a file browser, or pasting. You can upload assets to issues, pull requests, comments, and .md files in your repository.
-
-Using emojis
-You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:, a colon followed by the name of the emoji.
-
-@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:
-
-
-
-Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.
-
-For a full list of available emoji and codes, see the Emoji-Cheat-Sheet.
-
-Paragraphs
-You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.
-
-Footnotes
-You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:
-
-Here is a simple footnote[^1].
-
-A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].
-
-[^1]: My reference.
-[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
-  This is a second line.
-The footnote will render like this:
-
-
-
-Note
-
-The position of a footnote in your Markdown does not influence where the footnote will be rendered. You can write a footnote right after your reference to the footnote, and the footnote will still render at the bottom of the Markdown. Footnotes are not supported in wikis.
-
-Alerts
-Alerts are a Markdown extension based on the blockquote syntax that you can use to emphasize critical information. On {% data variables.product.github %}, they are displayed with distinctive colors and icons to indicate the significance of the content.
-
-Use alerts only when they are crucial for user success and limit them to one or two per article to prevent overloading the reader. Additionally, you should avoid placing alerts consecutively. Alerts cannot be nested within other elements.
-
-To add an alert, use a special blockquote line specifying the alert type, followed by the alert information in a standard blockquote. Five types of alerts are available:
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
-
-> [!TIP]
-> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.
-
-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.
-
-> [!WARNING]
-> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.
-
-> [!CAUTION]
-> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
-Here are the rendered alerts:
-
-
-
-Hiding content with comments
-You can tell {% data variables.product.github %} to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.
-
-<!-- This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->
-Ignoring Markdown formatting
-You can tell {% data variables.product.github %} to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.
-
-Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
-
-
-
-For more information on backslashes, see Daring Fireball's Markdown Syntax.
-
-Note
-
-The Markdown formatting will not be ignored in the title of an issue or a pull request.

 [[Int:{Airlanggayudhoyono@Intel-Mil.Info}|{{Mywebsite.com/Airlanggayudhoyono@Intel-Mil.Info}}]]
## About domain verification

After verifying ownership of your organization's domains, a "Verified" badge will display on the organization's profile. {% ifversion ghec %}If your organization has agreed to the {% data variables.product.company_short %} Customer Agreement, organization owners will be able to verify the identity of organization members by viewing each member's email address within the verified domain. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-organizations-profile) and [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/upgrading-to-the-github-customer-agreement).{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}
{% ifversion ghec %}If your organization is owned by an enterprise account, a{% else %}A{% endif %} "Verified" badge will display on your organization's profile for any domains verified for the enterprise account, in addition to any domains verified for the organization. Organization owners can view any domains that an enterprise owner has verified or approved, and edit the domains if the organization owner is also an enterprise owner. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise).
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.organizations.verified-domains-details %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}
After verifying ownership of your organization's domain, you can restrict email notifications for the organization to that domain. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/restricting-email-notifications-for-your-organization).
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec %}

> [!NOTE]
> To restrict email notifications to a verified domain, your organization must use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. {% data reusables.enterprise.link-to-ghec-trial %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec %}You can also verify custom domains used for {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} to prevent domain takeovers when a custom domain remains configured but your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site is either disabled or no longer uses the domain. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages).{% endif %}

If you confirm your organization’s identity by verifying your domain and restricting email notifications to only verified email domains, you can help prevent sensitive information from being exposed. For more information see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/best-practices-for-preventing-data-leaks-in-your-organization).

{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}

## About domain approval

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.approved-domains-beta-note %}

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.approved-domains-about %}

After you approve domains for your organization, you can restrict email notifications for activity within the organization to users with verified email addresses within verified or approved domains. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/restricting-email-notifications-for-your-organization).

Enterprise owners cannot see which organization members or email addresses receive notifications within approved domains.

Enterprise owners can also approve additional domains for organizations owned by the enterprise. {% ifversion ghec %}For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise).{% endif %}{% ifversion ghes %}For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise).{% endif %}
{% endif %}

## Verifying a domain for your organization

To verify a domain, you must have access to modify domain records with your domain hosting service.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.verified-domains %}
{% data reusables.organizations.add-a-domain %}
{% data reusables.organizations.add-domain %}
{% data reusables.organizations.add-dns-txt-record %}
1. Wait for your DNS configuration to change, which may take up to 72 hours. You can confirm your DNS configuration has changed by running the `dig` command on the command line, replacing `TXT-RECORD-NAME` with the name of the TXT record created in your DNS configuration. You should see your new TXT record listed in the command output.

   ```shell
   dig TXT-RECORD-NAME +nostats +nocomments +nocmd TXT
   ```

1. After confirming your TXT record is added to your DNS, follow steps one through three above to navigate to your organization's approved and verified domains.
{% data reusables.organizations.continue-verifying-domain %}
1. Optionally, once the "Verified" badge is visible on your organization's profile page, you can delete the TXT entry from the DNS record at your domain hosting service.

## Approving a domain for your organization

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.approved-domains-beta-note %}

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.verified-domains %}
{% data reusables.organizations.add-a-domain %}
{% data reusables.organizations.add-domain %}
{% data reusables.organizations.domains-approve-it-instead %}
{% data reusables.organizations.domains-approve-domain %}

## Removing an approved or verified domain

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.verified-domains %}
1. To the right of the domain to remove, select the {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Show more options" %} dropdown menu, then click **Delete**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Verified & approved domains" page. To the right of a domain, a kebab icon is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/organizations/continue-verifying-domain.png)
